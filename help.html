		<h3>How to build a tree:</h3>
		Mark the opening of constituents with an opening square bracket followed immediately by the category of the constituent. Leave a space between the category and anything to follow. This app will build the tree as you type and will attempt to close any brackets that you may be missing.<br />
		<h3>Examples:</h3>
		<font face="monospace">[NP Alice]</font><br />
		
		<font face="monospace">[NP [N Alice] and [N Bob]]</font><br />
		
		<font face="monospace">[S[NP[N Alice]][VP[V is][NP[N'[N a student][PP of physics]]]]]</font><br />
